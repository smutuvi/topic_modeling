AAR Insurance Kenya,AAR are white collar  conmen.they commit to pay but on the day of  settlement;they refuse to pay and send you from one staff to another and all act  that we are in meeting..call  so and so..they 're just callous 
AAR Insurance Kenya,AAR Insurance services are great and their prompt payments to the providers makes the clients get quick service. The AAR credit service also makes securing the AAR insurance easier. The installment payment is a boost.
AAR Insurance Kenya,"AAR is expensive, the staff do not fully understand the products and the issues covered are limited in terms of practitioners and services. How can you have a limit of 7000 spend for outpatient. If I'm sick how do you expect me to then find time AGAIN to go to hospital????? I can't wait for my cover to expire"
AAR Insurance Kenya,AAR is slow to respond to request even those that adds to its income. As corporate client speed is of essence to us and ensuring our staffs are well covered at all times. 
AAR Insurance Kenya,"Continue the good work, but try to communicate to clients from time to time to update them and rectify any issues raised on time. I commend Judith for her outstanding work and reaching out to her clients on timely manner."
AAR Insurance Kenya,"Do not seem to value your customers. Your call centre attendants are extremely unprofessional. Systems are inefficient (paediatrician schedule is erratic, some general practitioners have a poor rapport with kids, which is very discouraging for parents)."
AAR Insurance Kenya,Faster service between seeing the doctor on call & the pharmacy. Especially when ill the waiting period is to long.
AAR Insurance Kenya,"Good work, keep it up!"
AAR Insurance Kenya,"I am disappointed by how the customer care team handled my query. The service they offer is highly sensitive & personal, the customer care team should be more empathetic.\
My beneficiary was denied care because of an oversight by their own team & was forced to go to another clinic to get treatment at a fee even though we have insurance. AAR should do better."
AAR Insurance Kenya,"I like the clean environment at AAR and the staff are good too. I would be happier though if things would be done slightly faster as it will show a sense of urgency and concern for my well being. All the same, keep up with the good job."

AutoXpress,Please keep time. I waited for too long

I really love DTB very much, I was sent by my boss to deposit cash, but funny enough I didn't know where to start or end, when I entered I was stranded but the manager noticed from his office and customers care people also noticed from where they were attending the clients, they started by a nice smile approach and greetings, which was friendly that I remember up to date, they showed me step by step and I was happy, their customers are sharp even you ask them a question they have the answers in their finger tips, services are amazing. I love the way juma and Natasha keep us updated on social pages, answering questions, making people understand DTB bank services available and offered. May God bless you all. "

FauluKenya,Am comfortable transacting and doing businesses using Faulu Bank limited services...Deposits and withdrawal using my phone easily makes to to fall in love with Faulu
FauluKenya,Am not a member yet u keep sending those annoying sms 
FauluKenya,Customer service is poor. The numbers provided on the website aren't working. Social media messages are never replied
FauluKenya,"First& foremost is to thank the faulu management for the excellent services& quick you offer to us.\
Concern.\
How can I get a loan to start a business without being told to submit security.is it possible? And if so how to go about it."
FauluKenya,"I've had a very bad customer experience in paying my loan. Not just at my branch but with 'Faulu' generally. They have No honest and truthful communication, No transparency, loan never seems to reduce, Instant and huge arrears on the spot. Kindly be transparent on how you do your business!"
FauluKenya,Lower interest rates like the other banks did
FauluKenya,"On communication you as banking institution you should do something unique from others eg you find others notifies their customers their accounts flow and more information.\
"
FauluKenya,Review interest rates
FauluKenya,"You compare quite well with other  quality banks  give us better returns for our money\

Guaranty Trust Bank,"Excellent E-channels easy to use, minimal network down times."
Guaranty Trust Bank,"Good and prompt service from courteous staff, and hardly and queues "

Thank you."
Guaranty Trust Bank,Quality of service is not consistence and not the same across the branch. Need to improve on communication and the quality of the same
Guaranty Trust Bank,"Simply  Idont understand your core areas of service, Just that your halls are never busy does not mean your service is good coz when I get a few pple then I discover ucan really b slow. I almost lost my car at Mombasa port coz you refused to clear for me I pay after a month wholesome because of a delayed cheque.\
3.One of your staff on Bamburi road brach told me you give loans to corporates not hustlers! I wondered why I have bn banking there for more than 10yrs. I'm glad now that I have no money in your bank. "
Guaranty Trust Bank,The poor branch network and short banking hours make it an inconvenient bank to work with. FX rates are poor even for long time customers - it's tiresome to have to fight for rates offered easily at FX Bureaus for international transfers and drafts. No appreciation for customers
Guaranty Trust Bank,"Reduce bank charges\
Better interest rates\
\
\
"
Guaranty Trust Bank,Staff who follow up to the end
Guaranty Trust Bank,"The branch is well done, ACs should be looked into, staff are friendly. More products to capture the retail market in Kenya"
Hotpoint Appliances Ltd,"  WHEN I BROUGHT THE PART BACK, THE SERVICE CENTER SAID THEY COULD NOT RETURN IT..  THIS POLICY IS QUITE STUPID AND UNFAIR TO CUSTOMER WHO MAY ACCIDENTLY BUY THE WRONG PART ON THEIR OWN FAULT OR THE FAULT OF THE SERVICE CENTER. I TRUSTED THE SERVICE CENTER TO GET THE RIGHT PART AND THEY FAILED, SO IT IS CLEARLY THE FAULT OF THE SERVICE CENTER. THE PART i BROUGHT BACK IS UNUSED AND BRAND NEW.   THIS IS REALLY FRUSTRATING!!!   a good business is treating your customers well and this clearly is the opposite of that.  when asking to speak to a manager, all they could sy was hewas in a meeting. i don't have time towait, there shouldalways besomeone able to approva such things immediately whe it was the fault of teh company.  "
Hotpoint Appliances Ltd,1. The continued update at every stage of the work was excellent ; 2. My vacuum cleaner was fixed in two days (weekend actually). Keep it up!

Hotpoint Appliances Ltd,"Beth, was very pleasant and helpful with identification of the product. Besides, she communicated clearly. "
Hotpoint Appliances Ltd,Bought a washing machine from hotpoint which had some issues with the door after a month. Hotpoint replaced the machine when they could not obtain a spare door in good time. 
Hotpoint Appliances Ltd,Discounts should be increased. Otherwise everything else is excellent. Shout out to Ephie Murunga for good service.
Hotpoint Appliances Ltd,DISPLAY SOMETHING FOR SALE AND SHOULD ALWAYS BE COMPLETE.  IE THE LG TV ON OFFER HAD NO ACCESSORISE
Hotpoint Appliances Ltd,If you're a calm person you may wait over a month to get prioritized. 
Hotpoint Appliances Ltd,"Steve and Devanshish were very helpful. \
There is a good variety of products"
Hotpoint Appliances Ltd,"Susan was very knowledgeable on the product, and helped me make an informed decision. Prices can still be more affordable."
Kenya Orient Insurance Limited,"1) Getting  accident vehicle repairs approval takes rather long even after one has fulfilled all requirements.\
2) Reaching the 'right' staff member that is handling your case especially over the phone is next to impossible. So one's only option is to get to your offices which is time wasting in it self."
Kenya Orient Insurance Limited,"Always issue clients with policy documents, have not had mine for 2rd year now. have heard claims repudated and clients have no reference\
"
Kenya Orient Insurance Limited,Capital Hill branch has a good reception of walking in clients and service delivery is prompt . However slight delays are experienced when many walk in at the same time Delays are experienced on renewal notices not received in time.
Kenya Orient Insurance Limited,"Cheap premium rates,prompt service, goodustomer care,And constant touch with clients"
Kenya Orient Insurance Limited,i like how polite the staff and solution oriented. Not sure there is much to improve may be promptness/ waiting time
Kenya Orient Insurance Limited,"I visited KTDA branch nairobi for my policy document, more than five times and my cover expired before i got one.Nobody followed renewal of my cover. Kindly improve on this for future business"
Kenya Orient Insurance Limited,"Kenya orient is the best insurance so far, not complicated always ready to compensate."

Kenya Orient Insurance Limited,"You are so cooperative and always willing to satisfy a client .\
If you come up Claim portal will make me happier thanks"
NIC Bank Kenya,"After a lot of to an fro just to get my mobile banking up and running NIC finally got it done.  It is an easy and convenient way to handle my banking transactions. Although the mobile app service is good, I don't like the fact that NIC seems to charge for every tiny thing. Changing my mobile number on NIC system should not be chargeable."
NIC Bank Kenya,Alittle advice before one pays a non refundable  deposit on an asset would be nice if you are not going to give a loan.  I was told my statements look good then i lost my cash. Just sad. 
NIC Bank Kenya,"Am with NIC for one simple matter, technology and don't experience much red tape but you occasionally drop the ball but overall you have been good to me."
NIC Bank Kenya,"Appalling bank, no one seems in any way to know what they are doing.  Wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy.  8 months after receiving a letter of offer on a car loan and the person whom we bought the car from is still waiting for his money.  Are you in dire difficulties  ?"
NIC Bank Kenya,Communication is a little hit and miss with NIC.  Most times it takes numerous emails and phone call to sort out the simplest issue.
NIC Bank Kenya,Currently not yet a direct customer but get my payments/salary via Mpesa through your bank and I like it.
NIC Bank Kenya,Experts of unresponsiveness. Is everyone on a go slow? No department know what the other is doing. So glad to be leaving. 3 years of hell. 
NIC Bank Kenya,For a bank that wants to embrace technology it is tiring to think that it actuallys takes approx 1 month to set up and activate the mobile banking app.
NIC Bank Kenya,"Good, fast customer service. It is all we ever wanted. :)  Thanks"
NIC Bank Kenya,Great bank. Their service is swift. I can never bank with another bank.
Orient Life,"After having an insurance policy I expect to be getting statements. Moreover,  I cannot be aware of any changes in the Insurance provider unless I search for it myself. Finally the Orient for life policy is nowhere to be seen in your websites which made any referrals to my colleagues be filled with doubt as they feel it does not exist. Kindly amend these."
Orient Life,Because I have been following my refunds forever
Orient Life,Customer Centrism is not part of you.

Prudential Life Assurance Kenya Ltd,"Its because in rural arears you have not marketed yourself well that's why its hard to trust the company unlike your competitors. The  agents are not giving the correct information out there hence becoming untrustworth.\
"
Prudential Life Assurance Kenya Ltd,The agent didn't take me  through the policy correctly but now I understand.
Prudential Life Assurance Kenya Ltd,"The services are good i appreciate. I also have an issue with location  because some of us have disabilities and we are afraid of heights,if you could find an office in ground floor that would be good."

TACC Store,"Hi? I have been a regular customer since you opned tge Nyali Naivas. The service is good. Staff are very helpful especially Mr. Charles. However, i went there early this week to buy afew things and your computer systems were down. I had to leave the items go run some errands and when i came back the probkem was still there. This i saw was stressing the ladies(staff) alot. I had to be given a manual receipt. Kindly check on your IT department and have them rectify this since they are busy during this Sale period. Other than that, i have no complains whatsoever. \
Regards\
Eunice K."
TACC Store,I am sure it not well organised. I saw a Sofa set price on sale was 78000 when purchasing am told it's a mistake that's not the price. Is this my fault? When I have promised my mum. I took picture & concerned everything with it sells girls then this is what am told. I really need to work out on ur selves especial nrb offc. Thanx  plz consider
TACC Store,"i was not happy yesterday .i visited garden city branch to purchase a outdoor table with chairs .after carefully selecting .when i went to pay was informed it was booked.\
there a diffrent between paying cash and booking an item\
i was not happy at all"
TACC Store,"Mamta was very kind and helpful and was able to assist us in making decision to purchase but the lady that printed our invoice was very harsh and unfriendly and needs better communication skills as she actually told us' what are you waiting for we are done here!' It was  very offensive, kindly look into it. Invoice sale no SIB01570190"
TACC Store,Not enough staff during your sale. Guys helping with material were brilliant and very helpful. Ladies on check out very up helpful 
TACC Store,"Outstanding service received from Rita on several occasions, not just once.  Also Christopher was very helpful and pleasant - from the material section. \
Very friendly and courteous. \
Would be happier with more sales. "
TACC Store,Staff are sweet but clueless on product knowledge; systems for check out must be worst in country.  
TACC Store,"Succinct information regarding deliveries\
Day  - Garden city esp. Mombasa road is okay"
TACC Store,"Terrible service I am yet to receive my goods. I purchased in cash at Nyali Branch in 27th Nov 2017.  I was supposed to pick the goods at a location in Nairobi the next day as they were not enough items in stock in mombasa and was given a contact Tel number by Pinky. Since then I am being told I have not paid for the Goods and cannot collect them. I cannot get any assistance over the phone. Get organised TACC this is not the first time I’ve had rubbish customer service. \
\
Your staff were also complaining how they don’t like the sale that they are tired and need a break. In front of customers. I need my goods 0708226764, 0722721199. Pathetic. "
TACC Store,The procedures at your till take too much time and are very boring. I wish you could find a better way to save the customer time.
Telkom Kenya,"Clueless technicians! We have been chasing Telkom for over a month to sort out our corporate lines. Still waiting with the technicians never showing up for the appointments booked on site. Terrible service,"
Telkom Kenya,I really love Ur customer cares service s bt on quality in some areas I don't really enjoy internet services  value for money is awesome compared to Safaricom Airtel and MTN..
Telkom Kenya,"I recently asked if there was network breakdowns in our area and they were honest enough to confirm the same, so I was able to schedule my usage without wasting time. "
Telkom Kenya,"Service at T-Mall when i first got my line was amazing! When I requested to have my line changed to a 4G one, this too was done very efficiently. "
Telkom Kenya,"Telkom is by far the worst utility company we have had to deal with. They take forever to fix problems even with constant follow-up, no one calls back and their lines keep failing!"
Telkom Kenya,They are good but can be much better. educate people well and train all the staff more. 
Telkom Kenya,They have the best data bundles offers so far .They should improve  their network to 4g across the country not only on major towns 
Telkom Kenya,What is the point of a corporate relationship manager if he never picks up calls or replies to emails?
UAP Old Mutual Kenya, Fully discloser would have been vital for I to make a proper decision on value for money. Response to questions is poor and doggy.
UAP Old Mutual Kenya,After sales service is terrible; no statement s sent to me at all.
UAP Old Mutual Kenya,As policy holder old mutual  only remember when thier is due payment? I don’t receive any update or upcoming and benefit  of policy holder? They don’t even host event  to update customer and of new luncheon product? So as policy holder I feel  the company should do more for thier policy  holder and make them  participative  and awareness by inviting them as host in luncheon product and make existing policy holder to market what old mutual stand for? In conclusion i feel old mutual  should do more with existing policy to market them self which I don’t see?
UAP Old Mutual Kenya,Because I have been assisted satisfactory by the members of staff who are  always ready to work professionally.I was served by a lady known as Monica successfully  who enabled me to access my maturity due.The name had earlier been misspelled but she was able to correct the anomaly
UAP Old Mutual Kenya,"Communicating to clients through channels such as SMS and email are very helpful. Even when you don't visit the office, you still get to know what you are supposed to know or do and are advised appropriately."
UAP Old Mutual Kenya,Customer service always needs to be improved no matter what. Loosing a customer takes a minute maintaining one takes long hard work.keep in touch personally touch make them feel you care thank you
UAP Old Mutual Kenya,I am disappointed. I have applied for withdraw of my investments severally but not effected. I was serviced at Delmonte ltd by lady called Dorine from Thika branch but she left years back. I lost mine code. Please help to class this account n recover my savings
UAP Old Mutual Kenya,"I am happy with my current account manager, Mr Sammy Gikiri. He has been thoroughly professional and very patient at following up issues on my behalf. That's why l chose to reinvest my money with oldmutual. "
UAP Old Mutual Kenya,I got an education max policy but the way I have been treated is very inhuman and insensitive including constant lies and meeting not being set on time yet have 3policies with old mutual.This happened at head office upperhill Nairobi 
UAP Old Mutual Kenya,"I had a complain/issue which I was move around you offices till I wrote a email to you client services. In fact at one point I was promised to be called later from your customer service office at kimathi street which did not happen, also was direct by you team to visit any branch and I will be sorted out I did visit machakos branch to be sent away having travelled from Kitui, also when I come to your office at kimathi street the security guy at the gate kept directing to other offices claiming uap issues are not dealt with in that office. Take note I am a customer with you subsidiary Faulu and such mishandling is not fare at all to your organisation. The same matter has not been solved but I was given ten days from 9th Feb2018."
Victoria Courts,By adding more office furniture so we can have a variety to choose from..the customer service is brilliant.

Victoria Courts,"You have quality furniture ,but the prices are too high.\
 I will  be a happy customer,Only if you reduce the price slightly. "
Commercial Bank of Africa Kenya,"I received no response from a query I made on Twitter, "
Commercial Bank of Africa Kenya,Our company has been banking with CBD for the last 4 years and i have experienced there services to be top notch 
Commercial Bank of Africa Kenya,"Pesalink needs to be reliable. It keeps failing me all the time. I have to keep using a different bank for transactions.\
Credit card response is also simply average. Nobody wants to take the pain of finding a solution to my problem."
Commercial Bank of Africa Kenya,"The CBA IB (Internet Banking) portal somehow keeps going offline when I need it most. However, the customer service staff are always very helpful and their followups are consistent . If the bank can snuff out the IB issues, it would be doing everyone a big favour, and I mean 'MADUONG KABISA!'"
Commercial Bank of Africa Kenya,"While CBA has really friendly and good staff overall, the quality of communication scores a total F for failure. Frequent outages on the USSD or APP facilities are almost never communicated to us. Worse, when a transaction fails (and this is VERY common, for example, transfer of money from Bank to M-Pesa), the money does return to one's account after a day or so, BUT the transaction fees of about KES 82 are NEVER refunded. If one makes a few transfers a month, and they keep failing because failures are never communicated in time, these lost amounts can really become significant. This means we are being charged for non-services, and to me, this is plain theft. "
Internet Solutions,Excellent service. I can recommend anyone who needs internet services.
Internet Solutions,"Generally as a customer i am happy with your service, response, support and follow-ups. Only small thing noted with some downtime/interruptions  which are not communicated in time to us  and have to call to find out. Few cases to support this: when  KENIC were working on domain, minimal cases of fiber cuts which i think can better be communicated via texts where mail or other mode of communication is not possible."
Internet Solutions,I just wish your speeds were better and that you had better ways of communicating issues as they come up instead of disconnecting people without notice.
Internet Solutions,"Internet Solutions service is overall pretty good. They have an automated ticketing  system which acknowledges an issue straight away once you send the email. Improvement in communication would be useful as some of these tickets seem to slip through the net. \
\
The team themselves are however always helpful and on hand and one phone call puts us on the right track."
Internet Solutions,It would be useful to get direct line numbers for the people dealing with a query so that the query can be resolved faster. Back and forth on a ticketed email takes up time when a quick conversation with the  IT person handling the query can make a big difference.
Internet Solutions,"There are actually two parts to this.  Contacting them for a technical problem usually gets a good response (fast, capable).  But I have yet to receive replies to multiple emails over the past year with questions about my account.  Why have an email address for a customer that gets no reply? is what I have wondered.  Makes IS very susceptible to competition as competition grows."
Internet Solutions,"We have been your customer for long but currently we feel like we are dealing with a different company or management. we have been given an account manager who doesn't care. Your support department still doesn't care at all especially when faced with a unique challenge.\
You lost our website last december, you claim you don't have any records about it and upto now our website is still down."
Internet Solutions,Your current support department is a total joke compared to what you had last year. For example ask your staff what happened t richfield engineering ltd website.
JW Seagon,"Outstanding service and prompt, helpful communications. Would recommend 10/10."
JW Seagon,"Amon Langat, Florence Ciira and Rose Njoroge are especially excellent."
JW Seagon,I have always had a good claims experien with j w seagon 
JW Seagon,I have had a good experience with J W Seagon for as long as I have dealt with you.  
JW Seagon,Several staff members really stand out notably Florian and Caroline.
JW Seagon,"In my 35 years of dealing with insurance I have never had the confidence that I have had the broker looking out for me until I joined with JWSEAGON. Whilst I have been impressed by all I have dealt with, AUDREY has gone beyond call of duty to help when times are tough, and in normal days.  Thank you Audrey."
JW Seagon,"The staff are ever so helpful and courteous, taking time to explain everything you need to know. Consider better communication with doctors and payments with them! "
JW Seagon,I have had 3 requests over 6 months and Lillian resonded very quickly and keot me updated until  request were deskt eith and finalised.
JW Seagon,"Excellent service from the team here in Nairobi, prompt with responses at all times."
JW Seagon,Over the years have received nothing but the best service from JW Seagon.

Kichen,"It's too expensive with the delivery cost. Also, Kichen says they are a healthy option, but almost none of their options are low calorie/low carbs/diet friendly. Great service."
Kichen,Excellent Food. Enticing aroma. Well packaged. Delivery time was spectacular and right on the dot. 
Kichen,Ki.chen has a fantastic menu and they always aim to add something new every now and then to keep things fresh. Menu choices are healthy and more importantly delicious and at a great price!
